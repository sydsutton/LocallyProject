## Description

_{This is a responsive webiste that uses Bootstrap and custom CSS for design and responsiveness. Most of the pictures used are pulled from the web. On the home page, you don't have to input any information to actually search for a band. Clicked "search" will redirect you to the next page, regardless of the location information. Although clicking "save artist" on the artist's page with change the text and color of the button, no information is actually saved. There is some error handling in the "contact" page. }_
